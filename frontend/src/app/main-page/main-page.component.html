  <h2>Welcome to Nodejs/Angular application !</h2>
  <p>
    This application allows you to upload CSV files for products and orders,
    validate them, and then visualize the data in our PostgreSQL database.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the initialization the Backend already import some rows form 2 csv present in the Backend/resources directory.
    This is why you can already see some data in the visualization without having imported your own data!
